In order to find out if something is in Pig-Latin, one could test if the Pig-Latin endings are in the word. To test
if something is in ROT13, you could import a dictionary to see if the words are in there. Using conditional statements, 
one could test if it's in one language, then call upon that language's transform function from Transforms (in Pig-Latin, 
call unpigify from Transforms; in ROT13, call ROT13 from Transforms).
