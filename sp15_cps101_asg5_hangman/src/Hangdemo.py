Created on Jan 21, 2011

Modified on Feb 22, 2012, remove use
of dictionaries and read file by lines
rather than by words --- this will
make it easier to use non-words, i.e.,
lines like "Animal Farm" or "Jackson Pollock" 
if user wants to guess books or artists or ... 

Modified on October 7, 2012, now a source for copying
code rather than calling code in this module
